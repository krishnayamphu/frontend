      A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out
      sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern
      digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known
      as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
      tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer
      that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral
      equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers
      that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
      computer cluster.

      A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control
      systems, including simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and
      remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. Computers are
      at the core of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and
      mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which
      links billions of computers and users. Early computers were meant to be
      used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
      aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the
      Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate
      long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More
      sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in
      the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines
      were developed during World War II, both electromechanical and using
      thermionic valves. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s
      were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic
      integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the
      microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed,
      power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever
      since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (Moore's law
      noted that counts doubled every two years), leading to the Digital
      Revolution during the

      Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly
      using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device
      was most likely a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids
      throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones,
      etc.) which represented counts of items, likely livestock or grains,
      sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[a][4] The use of counting rods
      is one example. The Chinese suanpan (算盘). The number represented on this
      abacus is 6,302,715,408. The abacus was initially used for arithmetic
      tasks. The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as
      early as 2400 BCE. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or
      tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a
      checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it
      according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.[5] The
      Antikythera mechanism, dating back to ancient Greece circa 150–100 BCE, is
      an early analog computing device. The Antikythera mechanism is believed to
      be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, according to Derek J. de
      Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It
      was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of
      Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to
      approximately c. 100 BCE. Devices of comparable complexity to the
      Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century.[7]
      Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for
      astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented
      by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[8] The astrolabe was
      invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE
      and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere
      and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of
      working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An
      astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[9][10] and
      gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[11] Abū
      Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar
      astrolabe,[12] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[13] with
      a gear train and gear-wheels,[14] c. 1000 AD. The sector, a calculating
      instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry,
      multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares
      and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found
      application in gunnery, surveying and navigation. The planimeter was a
      manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over
      it with a mechanical linkage. A slide rule The slide rule was invented
      around 1620–1630, by the English clergyman William Oughtred, shortly after
      the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated
      analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule
      development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and
      square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions
      such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry
      and other functions. Slide rules with special scales are still used for
      quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide
      rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft. In the
      1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll
      (automaton) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number
      and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different
      messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically
      "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines,
      the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland,
      and still operates.[15] In 1831–1835, mathematician and engineer Giovanni
      Plana devised a Perpetual Calendar machine, which through a system of
      pulleys and cylinders could predict the perpetual calendar for every year
      from 0 CE (that is, 1 BCE) to 4000 CE, keeping track of leap years and
      varying day length. The tide-predicting machine invented by the Scottish
      scientist Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation
      in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically
      calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

      The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are
      tangible physical objects. Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound
      cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables,
      keyboards, printers and "mice" input devices are all hardware. The term

      A general-purpose computer has four main components: the arithmetic logic
      unit (ALU), the control unit, the memory, and the input and output devices
      (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by buses, often
      made of groups of wires. Inside each of these parts are thousands to
      trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by
      means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit (binary
      digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a "1",
      and when off it represents a "0" (in positive logic representation). The
      circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits
      may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.

    <h1 id="software">Software</h1>
    <p>
      Software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material
      form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a
      computer system that consists of encoded information or computer
      instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system
      is built. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and
      related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital
      media. It is often divided into system software and application software.
      Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be
      realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that
      cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible
      computer, it is sometimes called "firmware".

      The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all
      other machines is that they can be programmed. That is to say that some
      type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it
      will process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture
      often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language.
      In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or
      extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for word
      processors and web browsers for example. A typical modern computer can
      execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a
      mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting
      of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to
      write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain
      errors.
